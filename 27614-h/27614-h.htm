</blockquote>

  <p>I take up a work of European celebrity, and reflect awhile on its
  bibliographic peculiarities&mdash;which may almost pass for romance.</p>

  <p>It is a <i>Scottish</i> work with regard to the family connexion of
  its author: it is an <i>Irish</i> work with regard to the place of his
  nativity. It is an <i>English</i> work as to the scenes which it
  represents; a <i>French</i> work as to the language in which it was
  written; a <i>Dutch</i> work as to the country in which it came to light.
  It was formerly printed anonymously: it has since borne the name of its
  author. It was formerly printed for public sale: it has been twice
  printed for private circulation. It was formerly classed as fiction: it
  is now believed to be history.</p>

  <p>But we have too many enigmas in the annals of literature, and I must
  not add to the number. The work to which I allude is the <i>Mémoires du
  comte de Grammont par le comte Antoine Hamilton</i>.</p>

  <p>The various indications of a projected re-impression of the work
  remind me of my <i>portefeuille Hamiltonien</i>, and impose on me the
  task of a partial transcription of its contents.</p>

  <p>Of the numerous editions of the <i>Mémoires de Grammont</i> as
  recorded by Brunet, Renouard, or Quérard, or left unrecorded by those
  celebrated bibliographers, I shall describe only four; which I commend to
  the critical examination of future editors:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. "<i>Mémoires de la vie du comte de Grammont; contenant
  particuliérement l'histoire amoureuse de la cour d'Angleterre, sous le
  regne de Charles II.</i> A Cologne, chez Pierre Marteau, 1713.
  12<sup>o</sup>, pp. 4 + 428.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Avis du libraire.</span>&mdash;Il seroit inutile de
  recommander ici la lecture des mémoires qui composent ce volume: le titre
  seul de <i>Mémoires du comte de Grammont</i> réveillera sans doute la
  curiosité du public pour un homme qui lui est déjà si connu d'ailleurs,
  tant par la réputation qu'il a sçu se faire, que par les différens
  portraits qu'en ont donnez Mrs. de Bussi et de St. Evremont, dans leurs
  ouvrages; et l'on ne doute nullement qu'il ne reçoive, avec beaucoup de
  plaisir, un livre, dans lequel on lui raconte ses avantures, sur ce qu'il
  en a bien voulu raconter lui-même à celui qui a pris la peine de dresser
  ces mémoires.</p>

  <p>"Outre les avantures du comte de Grammont, ils contiennent
  particuliè[re]ment l'histoire amoureuse de la cour d'Angleterre, sous le
  regne de Charles II; et, comme on y découvre quantité de choses, qui ont
  été tenues cachées jusqu'à présent, et qui font voir jusqu'à quel excès
  on a porté le déréglement dans cette cour, ce n'est pas le morceau le
  moins intéressant de ces mémoires.</p>

  <p>"On les donne ici sur une copie manuscrite, qu'on en a reçue de Paris:
  et on les a fait imprimer avec le plus d'exactitude qu'il a été
  possible."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above is the <i>first</i> edition. The imprint is fictitious. It
  was much used by the Elzévirs, and by other Dutch printers. The second
  edition, with the same imprint, is dated in 1714 (Cat. de Guyon de
  Sardière, No. 939.). The third edition was printed at Rotterdam in 1716.
  The <i>avis</i> is omitted in that edition, and in all the later
  impressions which I have seen. Its importance as a history of the
  publication induces one to revive it. There is also an edition printed at
  Amsterdam in 1717 (Cat. de Lamy, No. 3918.); and another at La Haye in
  1731 (Cat. de Rothelin, No. 2534*). Brunet omits the edition of 1713.
  Renouard and Quérard notice it too briefly.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Avertissement.</span> Le public a fait un accueil si
  favorable à ces <i>Mémoires</i>, que nous avons crû devoir en procurer
  une nouvelle edition. Outre les avantures du comte de Grammont,
  très-piquantes par elles-mêmes, ils contiennent l'histoire amoureuse
  d'Angleterre sous le regne de Charles II. Ils sont d'ailleurs écrits
  d'une maniére si vive et si ingénieuse, qu'ils ne laisseroient pas de
  plaire infiniment, quand la matiére en seroit moins interessante.</p>

  <p>"Le héros de ces <i>Mémoires</i> a trouvé dans le comte Hamilton un
  historien digne de lui. Car on n'ignore plus qu'ils sont partis de la
  même main à qui l'on doit encore d'autres ouvrages frappés au même
  coin.</p>

  <p>"Nous avons enrichi cette edition d'un discours mêlé de prose et de
  vers, où l'on exagére la difficulté qu'il y a de bien répresenter le
  comte de Grammont. On reconnoîtra facilement que ce discours est du même
  auteur que les <i>Mémoires</i>, et qu'il devoit naturellement en <!--
  Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>orner le
  frontispice. Au reste il ne nous appartient point d'en apprécier le
  mérite. Nous dirons seulement que des personnes d'un goût sûr et délicat
  le comparent au <i>Voyage de Chapelle</i>, et qu'ils y trouvent les mêmes
  graces, le même naturel et la même légereté.</p>

  <p>"Il ne nous reste plus qu'à dire un mot de M. Hamilton lui-même,
  auteur de ces mémoires, et du discours qui les précede.</p>

  <p>"Antoine Hamilton dont nous parlons, étoit de l'ancienne et illustre
  maison de ce nom en Ecosse. Il nâquit en Irlande. Il eut pour pére le
  chevalier Georges Hamilton, petit-fils du duc d'Hamilton, qui fut aussi
  duc de Châtelleraud en France.</p>

  <p>"Sa mére étoit madame Marie Butler, s&oelig;ur du duc d'Ormond,
  viceroi d'Irlande, et grand maître de la maison du roi Charles.</p>

  <p>"Dans les révolutions qui arrivérent du tems de Cromwel, ils suivirent
  le roi et le duc d'Yorck son frére qui passérent en France. Ils y
  amenérent leur famille. Antoine ne faisoit à peine que de naître.</p>

  <p>"Lorsque le roi fut rétabli sur son trône, il ramena en Angleterre les
  jeux et la magnificence. On voit dans les mémoires de Grammont combien
  cette cour étoit brillante; la curiosité y attira le comte de Grammont.
  Il y vit mademoiselle d'Hamilton, il ne tarda pas à sentir le pouvoir de
  ses charmes, il l'épousa enfin; et c'est la tendresse qu'<i>Antoine</i>
  avoit pour sa s&oelig;ur, qui l'engagea à faire plusieurs voyages en
  France, où il étoit élevé, et où il a passé une partie de sa vie.</p>

  <p>"M. Antoine Hamilton étant catholique, il ne put obtenir d'emploi en
  Angleterre; et rien ne fut capable d'ébranler ni sa religion, ni la
  fidélité qu'il devoit à son roi.</p>

  <p>"Le roi Jaques étant monté sur le trône, il lui donna un regiment
  d'infanterie en Irlande et le gouvernement de Limeric. Mais ce prince,
  ayant été obligé de quitter ses etats le comte Hamilton repassa avec la
  famille royale en France. C'est-là et pendant le long séjour qu'il y a
  fait, qu'il a composé les divers ouvrages qui lui ont acquis tant de
  réputation. Il mourut à S. Germain le 21 Avril 1720. dans de grands
  sentimens de piété, et après avoir reçu les derniers sacremens. Il étoit
  âgé alors d'environ 74 ans. Il a mérité les regrets de tous ceux qui
  avoient le bonheur de le connoître. Né sérieux, il avoit dans l'esprit
  tous les agrémens imaginables; mais ce qui est plus digne de louanges, à
  ces agrémens, qui vent frivoles sans la vertu, il joignoit toutes les
  qualitéz du c&oelig;ur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the above <i>avertissement</i> first appeared in 1746, which I have
  much reason to conclude, this is certainly a very important edition. The
  biographical portion of the advertisement is the foundation of the later
  memoirs of Hamilton. In the Moréri of 1759, we have it almost
  <i>verbatim</i>, but taken from the <i>&OElig;uvres du comte Antoine
  Hamilton</i>, 1749. Neither Brunet, nor Renouard, nor Quérard notice the
  edition of 1746. The copy which I have examined has the book-plate
  G.&nbsp;III.&nbsp;R.</p>

  <p>This edition has the same <i>avertissement</i> as that of 1746. The
  imprint is <span class="scac">M.DCC.LX</span>. The type resembles our
  small pica, and the paper has the water-mark <i>Auvergne</i> 1749. At the
  end of the second part appears, <i>De l'imprimerie de Didot, rue
  Pavée</i>, 1760. This must be M. François Didot of Paris. I find the same
  colophon in the <i>Bibliographie instructive</i>, 1763-8. v. 631. This
  very neat edition has also escaped the aforesaid bibliographic trio!</p>

  been said of its brilliancy&mdash;and so, for the sake of novelty, I
  shall rather dwell on its flaws.</p>

  <p>The volume was printed at the private press of M. Horace Walpole at
  Strawberry-Hill, and the impression was limited to one hundred copies, of
  which thirty were sent to Paris. So much for its attractions&mdash;now
  for its flaws. In reprinting the dedication to madame du Deffand, I had
  to insert <i>eight</i> accents to make decent French of it! The
  <i>avis</i> is a mere medley of fragments: I could not ask a compositor
  to set it up! The <i>avertissement</i> is copied, without a word of
  intimation to that effect, from the edition of 1746. The notes to the
  <i>épître</i> are also copied from that edition, except <i>L'abbé de
  Chaulieu</i>; and two of the notes to the memoirs are from the same
  source. The other notes, in the opinion of sir William Musgrave, are in
  part taken from an erroneous printed <i>Key</i>. Where are the
  <i>éclaircissements</i>? I find none except a list of proper
  names&mdash;of which about one-third part is omitted!</p>

  <p>In quoting Brunet, I have used the fourth edition of the <i>Manuel du
  libraire</i>, 1842-4; in quoting Renouard, I refer to the <i>avis</i>
  prefixed to the <i>&OElig;uvres du comte Antoine Hamilton</i>, 1812; in
  quoting Quérard, to <i>La France littéraire</i>, 1827-39. The other
  references are to sale catalogues. The titles of the books described, and
  the extracts, are given <i>literatim</i>, and, except as above noted,
  with the same accentuation and punctuation.</p>

  <p>To revert to the question of a new edition: I should prefer the French
  text, for various reasons, to any English translation that could be made.
  That of Abel Boyer is wretched burlesque!</p>

  <p>The chief requirements of a French edition would be, a collation of
  the editions of 1713 and 1746&mdash;the rectification of the names of
  persons <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>and places&mdash;a revision of the
  punctuation&mdash;and a strict conformity, as to general orthography and
  accentuation, with the <i>Dictionnaire de l'Académie française</i>, as
  edited in 1835. The substance of the <i>avis</i> of 1713 might be stated
  in a preface; and the <i>avertissement</i> of 1746, a clever composition,
  would serve as an introduction and memoir of the author. Those who doubt
  its value may consult the <i>Grand dictionnaire historique</i>, and the
  <i>Biographie universelle</i>. As one hundred and sixty persons are
  noticed in the work, brevity of annotation is very desirable. It would
  require much research. The manuscript notes of sir William Musgrave
  would, however, be very serviceable&mdash;more so, I conceive, than the
  printed notes of M. Horace Walpole.</p>

  <p>As the indications of a projected re-impression may be fallacious, I
  shall conclude with a word of advice to inexperienced collectors. Avoid
  the <i>jolie édition</i> printed at Paris by F.&nbsp;A. Didot, <i>par ordre de
  monseigneur le comte d'Artois</i>, in 1781. It is the very worst specimen
  of editorship. Avoid also the London edition of 1792. The preface is a
  piratical pasticcio; the verbose notes are from the most accessible
  books; the portraits, very unequal in point of execution, I believe to be
  chiefly copies of prints&mdash;not <i>d'après des tableaux originaux</i>.
  The most desirable editions are, 1. The edition of 1760; 2. That of 1772,
  as a <i>curiosity</i>; 3. That edited by M. Renouard, Paris, 1812,
  18<sup>o</sup>. 2 vols.; 4. That edited by M. Renouard in 1812,
  8<sup>o</sup>. with eight portraits. The latter edition forms part of the
  <i>&OElig;uvres du comte Antoine Hamilton</i> in 3 vols. It seldom occurs
  for sale.</p>

<h3>THE "ANCREN RIWLE."</h3>

  <p>The publication of this valuable semi-Saxon or Early English treatise
  on the duties of monastic life, recently put forth by the Camden Society,
  under the editorship of the Rev. James Morton, is extremely acceptable,
  and both the Society and the editor deserve the cordial thanks of all who
  are interested in the history of our language. As one much interested in
  the subject, and who many years since entertained the design now so ably
  executed by Mr. Morton, I may perhaps be allowed to offer a few remarks
  on the work itself, and on the manuscripts which contain it. Mr. Morton
  is unquestionably right in his statement that the Latin MS. in Magdalen
  College, Oxford, No. 67., is only an abridged translation of the original
  vernacular text. Twenty-three years ago I had access to the same MS. by
  permission of the Rev. Dr. Routh, the President of Magdalen College, and
  after reading and making extracts from it<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, I came to the same conclusion as
  Mr. Morton. It hardly admits, I think, of a doubt; for even without the
  internal evidence furnished by the Latin copy, the age of the manuscripts
  containing the Early English text at once set aside the supposition that
  Simon of Ghent (Bishop of Salisbury from 1297 to 1315) was the original
  author of the work. The copy in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, I have
  not seen, but of the three copies in the British Museum I feel confident
  that the one marked Cleopatra C. vi. was actually written before Bishop
  Simon of Ghent had emerged from the nursery. This copy is not only the
  oldest, but the most curious, from the corrections and alterations made
  in it by a somewhat later hand, the chief of which are noticed in the
  printed edition. The collation, however, of this MS. might have been,
  with advantage, made more minutely, for at present many readings are
  passed over. Thus, at p. 8., for <i>unweote</i> the second hand has
  <i>congoun</i>; at p. 62., for <i>herigen</i> it has <i>preisen</i>; at
  p. 90., for <i>on cheafle</i>, it reads <i>o muþe</i>, &amp;c. The
  original hand has also some remarkable variations, which would cause a
  suspicion that this was the first draft of the author's work. Thus, at p.
  12., for <i>scandle</i>, the first hand has <i>schonde</i>; at p. 62.,
  for <i>baldeliche</i> it reads <i>bradliche</i>; at p. 88., for <i>nout
  for</i>, it has <i>anonden</i>, and the second hand <i>aneust</i>; at p.
  90., for <i>sunderliche</i> it reads <i>sunderlepes</i>, &amp;c. All
  these, and many other curious variations, are not noticed in the printed
  edition. On the fly-leaf of this MS. is written, in a hand of the time of
  Edward I., as follows: "<i>Datum abbatie et conventui de Leghe per Dame
  M. de Clare.</i>" The lady here referred to was doubtless Maud de Clare,
  second wife of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hereford and Gloucester, who, at
  the beginning of the reign of Edward I., is known to have changed the
  Augustinian Canons of Leghe, in Devonshire, into an abbess and nuns of
  the same order; and it was probably at the same period she bestowed this
  volume on them. The conjecture of Mr. Morton, that Bishop Poore, who died
  in 1237, might have been the original author of the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>,
  is by no means improbable, and deserves farther inquiry. The error as to
  Simon of Ghent is due, in the first place, not to Dr. Smith, but to
  Richard James (Sir Robert Cotton's librarian), who wrote on the
  fly-leaves of all the MSS. in the Cottonian Library a note of their
  respective contents, and who is implicitly followed by Smith. Wanley is
  more blamable, and does not here evince his usual critical accuracy, but
  (as remarked by Mr. Morton) he could only have looked at a few pages of
  the work. The real fact seems to be that Simon of Ghent made the abridged
  Latin version of the seven books of the <i>Riwle</i> now preserved in
  Magdalen College, and this supposition may well enough be reconciled with
  the words of Leland, who says of him,&mdash;</p>

  Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>ad Virgines
  Tarentinas, Duriæ cultrices."&mdash;<i>Comment</i>., p. 316.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A second copy of the Latin version was formerly in the Cottonian
  collection (Vitellius E. vii.), but no fragment of it has hitherto been
  recovered from the mass of burnt crusts and leaves left after the fire of
  1731. I am happy, however, to add, that within the last few months, the
  manuscript marked Vitellius F. vii., containing a French translation of
  the <i>Riwle</i>, made in the fourteenth century (very closely agreeing
  with the vernacular text), has been entirely restored, except that the
  top margins of the leaves have been burnt at each end of the volume. This
  damage has, unfortunately, carried away the original heading of the
  treatise, and the title given us by Smith is copied partly from James's
  note. This copy of the French version appears to be unique, and is the
  more interesting from its having a note at the end (now half obliterated
  by the fire), stating that it belonged to Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of
  Gloucester, whose motto is also added, "<i>Plesance. M [mil]. en vn</i>."
  The personage in question was Eleanor, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun,
  Earl of Hereford, and wife of Thomas of Woodstock, who ended her days as
  a nun in the convent at Barking in 1399. Is any other instance known of
  the use of this motto? Before I conclude these brief remarks, I may
  mention a <i>fifth</i> copy of the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, which has escaped
  the notice of Mr. Morton. It is buried in the enormous folio manuscript
  of old English poetry and prose called the Vernon MS., in the Bodleian
  Library, written in the reign of Richard II., and occurs at pp.
  371<sup>b</sup>.&mdash;392. In the table of contents prefixed to this
  volume it is entitled "The Roule of Reclous;" and although the
  phraseology is somewhat modernised, it agrees better with the MS.
  Cleopatra C. vi, than with Nero A. xiv., from which Mr. Morton's edition
  is printed. This copy is not complete, some leaves having been cut out in
  the sixth book, and the scribe leaves off at p. 420. of the printed
  edition.</p>

  <p>It is very much to be wished that Mr. Morton would undertake the task
  of editing another volume of legends, homilies, and poems, of the same
  age as the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, still existing in various manuscripts.
  One of the homilies, entitled "Sawles Warde," in the Bodley MS. 34.,
  Cott. MS. Titus D. xviii., and Old Royal MS. 17<span

<h3>ORDER FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VAGRANCY,
A.D. 1650-51.</h3>

  <p>At a time when the question of "What is to be done with our vagrant
  children?" is occupying the attention of all men of philanthropic minds,
  it may be worth while to give place in your pages to the following order
  addressed by the Lord Mayor of London to his aldermen in 1650-51, which
  applies, amongst other things, to that very subject. It will be seen that
  some of the artifices of beggary in that day were very similar to those
  with which we are now but too familiar. The difference of treatment
  between vagrant children over and under nine years of age, is worthy of
  observation.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"<span class="sc">By the Mayor</span>.</p>

  <p>"Forasmuch as of late the constables of this city have neglected to
  put in execution the severall wholsome laws for punishing of vagrants,
  and passing them to the places of their last abode, whereby great
  scandall and dishonour is brought upon the government of this city; These
  are therefore to will and require you, or your deputy, forthwith to call
  before you the several constables within your ward, and strictly to
  charge them to put in execution the said laws, or to expect the penalty
  of forty shillings to be levyed upon their estates, for every vagrant
  that shal be found begging in their several precincts. And to the end the
  said constables may not pretend ignorance, what to do with the several
  persons which they shal find offending the said laws, these are further
  to require them, that al aged or impotent persons who are not fit to
  work, be passed from constable to constable to the parish where they
  dwel; and that the constable in whose ward they are found begging, shal
  give a passe under his hand, expressing the place where he or she were
  taken, and the place whither they are to be passed. <i>And for children
  under five years of age, who have no dwelling, or cannot give an account
  of their parents, the parish where they are found are to provide for
  them; and for those which shall bee found lying under stalls, having no
  habitation or parents (from five to nine years old), are to be sent to
  the Wardrobe House</i><a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, <i>to be provided for by the
  corporation for the poore; and all above nine years of age are to be sent
  to Bridewel.</i> And for men or women who are able to work and goe
  begging with young children, such persons for the first time to be passed
  to the place of their abode as aforesaid; and being taken againe, they
  are to be carryed to Bridewel, to be corrected according to the
  discretion of the governours. <i>And for those persons that shal be found
  to hire children, or go begging with children not sucking, those children
  are to be sent to the several parishes wher they dwel, and the persons so
  hiring them to Bridewel, to be corrected and passed away, or kept at work
  there, according to the governour's discretion.</i> And for al other
  vagrants and beggars under any pretence whatsoever, to be forthwith sent
  down to Bridewel to be imployed and corrected, according to the statute
  laws of this commonwealth, except before excepted; and the president and
  governours of Bridewel are hereby desired to meet twice every week to see
  to the execution of this Precept. <i>And the steward of the workehouse
  called the Wardrobe, is <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>authorised to receive into that house such
  children as are of the age between five and nine, as is before specified
  and limited</i>; and the said steward is from time to time to acquaint
  the corporation for the poor, what persons are brought in, to the end
  they may bee provided for. Dated this four and twentyeth day of January,
  1650.</p>

  Brook may know where to demand it. This, I presume, may be done.</p>

  <p>If you have met with Books printed by Guttenberg, you have made a
  great discovery. I thought there had been none such in the world, and
  began to look upon Fust as the first Printer. I have seen the Bishop of
  Ely's Catholicon (now with us), which, for aught I know, may have been
  printed by Guttenberg; for tho' it be printed at Ments, yet there is no
  name of the Printer, and the character is more rude than Fust's Tullie's
  Offices, whereof there are two Copies in 1465 and 1466, the first on

  <p>May I make a small enquiry, after the mention of so great a name as
  Guttenberg? I remember, you told me, my Lord Harley had two Copies of
  Edw. the Sixth's first Common Prayer Book. Do you remember whether either
  of them be printed by Grafton, the King's Printer? I have seen four or
  five Editions by Whitchurch, but never could meet with any by Grafton,
  except one in my custody, which I shall look upon to be a great Rarity,
  if it be likewise wanting to my Lord's Collection. It varies from all the
  other Copies, and is printed in 1548. All the rest, I think, in 1549. One
  reason of my enquiry is, because I want the Title, for the date is at the
  end of the Book, and indeed twice; both on the end of the Communion
  Office, and of the Litany. But I beg your pardon for so small an enquiry,
  whilst you are in quest of Guttenberg and Nic. Jenson. My business

<h3>BURIAL-PLACE OF ARCHBISHOP LEIGHTON.</h3>

  <p>On a visit this autumn with some friends to the picturesque village
  and church of Horsted-Keynes, Sussex, our attention was forcibly arrested
  by the appearance of two large pavement slabs, inserted in an erect
  position on the external face of the south wall of the chancel. They
  proved to be those which once had covered and protected the grave of the
  good Archbishop Leighton, who passed the latter years of his life in that
  parish, and that of Sir Ellis Leighton, his brother. On inquiry, it
  appeared that their remains had been deposited within a small chapel on
  the south side of the chancel, the burial-place of the Lightmaker family,
  of Broadhurst, in the parish of Horsted. The archbishop retired thither
  in 1674, and resided with his only sister, Saphira, widow of Mr. Edward
  Lightmaker. Broadhurst, it may be observed, is sometimes incorrectly
  mentioned by the biographers of Archbishop Leighton as a parish; it is an
  ancient mansion, the residence formerly of the Lightmakers, and situated
  about a mile north of the village of Horsted. There it was that Leighton
  made his will, in February, 1683; but his death occurred, it will be
  remembered, in singular accordance with his desire often expressed, at an
  inn, the Bell, in Warwick Lane, London.</p>

  <p>The small chapel adjacent to the chancel, and opening into it by an
  arch now walled up, had for some time, as I believe, been used as a
  school-room; more recently, however, either through its becoming out of
  repair, or from some other cause, the little structure was demolished.
  The large slabs which covered the tombs of the good prelate and his
  brother were taken up and fixed against the adjoining wall. The turf now
  covers the space thus thrown into the open churchyard; nothing remains to
  mark the position of the graves, which in all probability, ere many years
  elapse, will be disturbed through ignorance or heedlessness, and the
  ashes of Leighton scattered to the winds.</p>

  <p>In times when special respect has been shown to the tombs of worthies
  of bygone times, with the recent recollection also of what has been so
  well carried out by <span class="sc">Mr. Markland</span> in regard to the
  grave of Bishop Ken, shall we not make an effort to preserve from
  desecration and oblivion the resting-place of one so eminent as Leighton
  for his learning and piety, so worthy to be held in honoured remembrance
  for his high principles and his consistent conduct in an evil age?</p>

  small: but I remember a valuable Greek grammar prepared by the Rev.

  Gloucester, for the use of that establishment; as also a peculiar English
  grammar prepared by the Rev. R.&nbsp;S. Skillern, master of St. Mary de Crypt
  School, in the same place, for the use of that school. I also possess a
  copy (1640) of the <i>Romanæ Historiæ Anthologia</i>, for the use of
  Abingdon School, and <i>Moses and Aaron, or the Rites and Customs of the
  Hebrews</i> (1641), both by Thos. Godwin, though the latter was written

  <p>Originally, the words <i>to captivate</i> were synonymous with <i>to

  <p><i>Bohn's Edition of Matthew of Westminster.</i>&mdash;Under the year
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 782, the translator informs us that
  "Hirenes and <i>his</i> son Constantine became emperors." Such an emperor
  is not to be found <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>in the annals of Constantinople. If Mr. Yonge,
  who shows elsewhere that he has read Gibbon, had referred to him on this
  occasion, he would probably have found that the Empress Irene, a name
  dear to the reverencers of images, was the person meant. The original
  Latin probably gives no clue to the sex; but still this empress, who is
  considered as a saint by her church, notwithstanding the deposition and
  blinding of her own son, was not a personage to be so easily
  forgotten.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>DOMESTIC LETTERS OF EDMUND BURKE.</h3>

  <p>In the curious and able article entitled "The Domestic Life of Edmund
  Burke," which appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Dec. 10th and Dec. 17th
  (and to which I would direct the attention of such readers of "N. &amp;
  Q." as have not yet seen it), the writer observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is not in existence, as far as we know, or have a right to
  infer from the silence of the biographers, one single letter, paper, or
  document of any kind&mdash;except a mysterious fragment of one
  letter&mdash;relating to the domestic life of the Burkes, until long
  after Edmund Burke became an illustrious and public man; no letters from
  parents to children, from children to parents, from brother to brother,
  or brother to sister."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And as Edmund Burke was the last survivor of the family, the inference
  drawn by the writer, that they were destroyed by him, seems, on the
  grounds which he advances, a most reasonable one. But my object in
  writings is to call attention to a source from which, if any such letters
  exist, they may yet possibly be recovered; I mean the collections of
  professed collectors of autographs. On the one hand, it is scarcely to be
  conceived that the destroyer of these materials for the history of the
  Burkes, be he who he may, can have got <i>all</i> the family
  correspondence into his possession. On the other, it is far from
  improbable that in some of the collections to which I have alluded, some
  letters, notes, or documents may exist, treasured by the possessors as
  mere autographs; but which might, if given to the world, serve to solve
  many of those mysteries which envelope the early history of Edmund Burke.
  The discovery of documents of such a character seems to be the special
  province of "N. &amp; Q.," and I hope, therefore, although this letter
  has extended far beyond the limits I originally contemplated, you will
  insert it, and so permit me to put this Query to autograph collectors,
  "Have you any documents illustrative of the Burkes?" and to add as a
  Note, "If so, print them!"</p>

  of Elizabeth, that it is "unique, formerly in the collection of Thomas
  Sawbridge, Esq., but at present in the collection of Thomas Knight, Esq.,
  who purchased the whole cabinet."&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fairfax, Baron, Charles Snowdon Fairfax, 1627, Baron Fairfax, of
  Cameron; suc. his grandfather, Thomas, ninth baron, 1846. His lordship
  resides at Woodburne, in Maryland, United States."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Fairfax is not a Scotch name. And I can find no trace of any person of
  that family taking a part in Scotch affairs. <i>Cameron</i> is, I
  suppose, the parish of that name in the east of Fife.</p>

  <p>I wish to ask, 1st. For what services, or under what circumstances,
  the barony was created?</p>

  <p>2ndly. When did the family cease to possess land or other property in
  Scotland, if they ever held any?</p>

  <p>3rdly. Is the present peer a citizen or subject of the United States?
  If so, is he known and addressed as <i>Lord</i> Fairfax, or how?</p>

  <p>4thly. Has he, or has any of his ancestors, since the recognition of
  the United States as a nation, ever used or applied for permission to
  exercise the functions of a peer of Scotland, <i>e.g.</i> in the election
  of representative peers?</p>

  <p>5thly. If he be a subject of the United States, and have taken,
  expressly or by implication, the oath of citizenship (which pointedly
  renounces allegiance to our sovereign), how is it that his name is
  retained on the roll of a body whose first duty it is to guard the
  throne, and whose existence is a denial of the first proposition in the
  constitution of his country?</p>

  <p><i>Naval Atrocities.</i>&mdash;In the article on "Wounds," in the

  mentioning the necessity of a surgeon's being cautious in pronouncing on
  the character of any wound, adds that "this is particularly necessary on
  board ship, where, as soon as any man is pronounced by the surgeon to be
  mortally wounded, he is forthwith, while still living and conscious,
  thrown overboard," or words to this effect, as I quote from memory. That
  such horrid barbarity was not practised in 1810, it is needless to say;
  and if it had been usual at any previous period, Smollett and other
  writers who have exposed with unsparing hand all the defects in the naval
  system of their day, would have scarcely left this unnoticed when they
  attack much slighter abuses. If such a thing ever occurred, even in the
  worst of times, it must have been an isolated case. I have not met
  elsewhere with any allusion to this passage, or the atrocity recorded in
  it, and would be glad of more information on the subject.</p>

  <p>"The people in their distress met with an unexpected and providential

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Lawless Court, Rochford, Essex.</i>&mdash;A most extraordinary
  custom exists, in a manor at Rochford, in the tenants holding under what
  is called the "Lawless Court." This court is held at midnight, by
  torch-light, in the centre of a field, on the first Friday after the 29th
  Sept., and is presided over by the steward of the manor, who, however,
  appoints a deputy to fulfil this part of his duty. The tenants of the
  manor are obliged to attend to answer to their names, when called upon,
  under pain of a heavy fine, or at all events have some one there to
  respond for them. All the proceedings are carried on in a whisper, no one
  speaking above that tone of voice; and the informations as to deaths,
  names, &amp;c. are entered in a book by the president with a piece of
  charcoal. I may add, the business is not commenced until a cock has
  crowed three times, and as it is sometimes a difficult matter to get
  Chanticleer to do his duty, a man is employed to crow, whose fee therefor
  is 5<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>Now Morant, in his <i>History of Essex</i>, merely cursorily mentions
  this most singular custom, and has nothing as to its antiquity or origin;
  I should therefore feel much obliged for any information concerning
  it.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The singular custom at Rochford is of uncertain origin: in old
  authors it is spoken of as belonging to the manor of Rayleigh. The
  following account of "The Lawless Court," at that place, is printed by
  Hearne from the Dodsworth MSS. in the Bodleian, vol. cxxv.:&mdash;"The
  manor of Raylie, in Essex, hath a custome court kept yearly, the
  Wednesday nexte after Michael's day. The court is kept in the night, and
  without light, but as the skye gives, att a little hill without the
  towne, called the King's Hill, where the steward writes only with coals,
  and not with inke. And many men and mannors of greate worth hold of the
  same, and do suite unto this strange court, where the steward calls them
  with as low a voice as possibly he may; giving no notice when he goes to
  the hill to keepe the same court, and he that attends not is deepely
  amerced, if the steward will. The title and entry of the same court is as
  followeth, viz.:</p>

  the date of the event, whatever that may be, which is referred to in the

  France for peace were readily listened to; and both parties being in
  earnest, the preliminaries were readily settled at Fontainebleau (Nov.
  3rd). In spite of the declamation of Mr. Pitt and his party, they were
  approved of by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament, and a
  treaty was finally signed in Paris, Feb. 18, 1763." The napkins were
  probably a gift, on the occasion, to some public functionary. For the

<h3>RAPPING NO NOVELTY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 512. 632.)</p>

  <p>The story referred to is certainly a very curious one, and I should
  like to know whether it is exactly as it was told by Baxter, especially
  as there seems to be reason for believing that De Foe (whom on other
  grounds one would not trust in such a matter) did not take it from the
  work which he quotes. Perhaps if you can find room for the statement,
  some correspondent would be so good as to state whether it has the
  sanction of Baxter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Baxter, in his <i>Historical Discourse of Apparitions</i>, writes
  thus: 'There is now in London an understanding, sober, pious man, oft one
  of my hearers, who has an elder brother, a gentleman of considerable
  rank, who having formerly seemed pious, of late years does often fall
  into the sin of drunkenness; he often lodges long together here in his
  brother's house, and whensoever he is drunk and has slept himself sober,
  something knocks at his bed's head, as if one knocked on a wainscot. When
  they remove his bed it follows him. Besides other loud noises on other
  parts where he is, that all the house hears, they have often watched him,
  and kept his hands lest he should do it himself. His brother has often
  told it me, and brought his wife, a discreet woman, to attest it, who
  avers moreover, that as she watched him, she has seen his shoes under the
  bed taken up, and nothing visible to touch them. They brought the man
  himself to me, and when we asked <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>him how he dare sin again after such a
  warning, he had no excuse. But being persons of quality, for some special
  reason of worldly interest I must not name him.'"&mdash;De Foe's <i>Life
  of Duncan Campbell</i>, 2nd ed. p. 107.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After this story, De Foe says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Another relation of this kind was sent to Dr. Beaumont (whom I myself
  personally knew, and which he has inserted in his account of genii, or
  familiar spirits) in a letter by an ingenious and learned clergyman of
  Wiltshire," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But he does not say that the story which he has already quoted as from
  Baxter stands just as he has given it, and with a reference to Baxter, in
  Beaumont's <i>Historical, Physiological, and Theological Treatise of
  Spirits</i>, p. 182. Of course one does not attach any weight to De Foe's
  saying that he knew Dr. Beaumont "personally," but does anybody know
  anything of him? Nearly four years ago you inserted somewhat similar
  inquiry about this Duncan Campbell, but I believe it has not yet been
  answered.</p>

<h3>CELTIC AND LATIN LANGUAGES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 174.)</p>

  <p>There was a Query some time ago upon this subject, but though it is
  one full of interest to all scholars, I have not observed any Notes worth
  mentioning in reply. The connexion between these two languages has only
  of late occupied the attention of philologers; but the more closely they
  are compared together, the more important and the more striking do the
  resemblances appear; and the remark of Arnold with regard to Greek
  literature applies equally to Latin, "that we seem now to have reached
  that point in our knowledge of the language, at which other languages of
  the same family must be more largely studied, before we can make a fresh
  step in advance." But this study, as regards the comparison of Celtic and
  Latin, is, in England at least, in a very infant state. Professor Newman,
  in his <i>Regal Rome</i>, has attention to the subject; but his induction
  does not appear sufficiently extensive to warrant any decisive conclusion
  respecting the position the Celtic holds as an element of the Latin.
  Pritchard's work upon the subject is satisfactory as far as it goes, but
  both these authors have chiefly confined themselves to a tabular view of
  Celtic and Latin words; but it is not <i>merely</i> this we want. What is
  required is a critical examination into the comparative structure and
  formal development of the two languages, and this is a work still to be
  accomplished. The later numbers of Bopp's <i>Comparative Grammar</i> are,
  I believe, devoted to this subject, but as they have not been translated,
  they must be confined to a limited circle of English readers, and I have
  not yet seen any reproduction of the views therein contained in the
  philological literature of England.</p>

  <p>As the first step to considerations of this kind must be made from a
  large induction of words, I think, with your correspondent, that the
  pages of "N. &amp; Q." might be made useful in supplying "links of
  connexion" to supply a groundwork for future comparison. I shall conclude
  by suggesting one or two "links" that I do not remember to have seen
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>1. Is the root of <i>felix</i> to be found in the Irish <i>fail</i>,
  <i>fate</i>; the contraction of the dipththong <i>ai</i> or <i>ê</i>
  being analogous to that of <i>amaïmus</i> into <i>amêmus</i>?</p>

  <p>2. Is it not probable that <i>Avernus</i>, if not corrupted from <span
  title="aornos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&omicron;&rho;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, is related to
  <i>iffrin</i>, the Irish <i>inferi</i>? This derivation is at any rate
  more probable than that of Grotefend, who connects the word with <span
  title="Acherôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F08;&chi;&#x1F73;&rho;&omega;&nu;</span>.</p>

  <p>3. Were the <i>Galli</i>, priests of Cybele, so called as being
  connected with fire-worship? and is the name at all connected with the
  Celtic <i>gal</i>, a flame? The word <i>Gallus</i>, a Gaul, is of course
  the same as the Irish <i>gal</i>, a stranger.</p>

<h3>GEOMETRICAL CURIOSITY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 468.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby's</span> question might easily be the
  foundation of a geometrical paper; but as this would not be a desirable
  contribution, I will endeavour to keep clear of technicalities, in
  pointing out how the process described may give something near to a
  circle, or may not.</p>

  <p>When a paper figure, bent over a straight line in it, has the two
  parts perfectly fitting on each other, the figure is <i>symmetrical</i>
  about that straight line, which may be called an <i>axis of symmetry</i>.
  Thus every diameter of a circle is an axis of symmetry: every regular
  oval has two axes of symmetry at right angles to each other: every
  regular polygon of an <i>odd</i> number of sides has an axis joining each
  corner to the middle of the opposite sides: every regular polygon of an
  <i>even</i> number of sides has axes joining opposite corners, and axes
  joining the middles of opposite sides.</p>

  <p>When a piece of paper, of any form whatsoever, rectilinear or
  curvilinear, is doubled over any line in it, and when all the parts of
  either side which are not covered by the other are cut away, the unfolded
  figure will of course have the creased line for an axis of symmetry. If
  another line be now creased, and a fold made over it, and the process
  repeated, the second line becomes an axis of symmetry, and the first
  perhaps ceases to be one. If the process be then repeated on the first
  line, this last becomes an axis, and the other (probably) ceases to be an
  axis. If this process can be indefinitely continued, the cuttings must
  become smaller and smaller, for the following reason. Suppose, at the
  outset, the boundary point nearest to the intersection of the axes is
  distant from that intersection by, say four inches; it is clear that we
  cannot, after any number of cuttings, have a part of the boundary at less
  than four inches from the intersection. For there never is, after any
  cutting, any approach to the intersection except what there already was
  on the other side of the axis employed, before that cutting was made. If
  then the cuttings should go on for ever, or practically until the pieces
  to be cut off are too small, and <i>if this take place all round</i>, the
  figure last obtained will be a good representation of a circle of four
  inches radius. On the suppositions, we must be always cutting down, at
  all parts of the boundary; but it has been shown that we can never come
  nearer than by four inches to the intersection of the axes.</p>

  <p>But it does not follow that the process <i>will</i> go on for ever. We
  may come at last to a state in which both the creases are axes of
  symmetry at once; and then the process stops. If the paper had at first a
  curvilinear boundary, properly chosen, and if the axes were placed at the
  proper angle, it would happen that we should arrive at a <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span><i>regular</i>
  curved polygon, having the two axes for axes of symmetry. The process
  would then stop.</p>

  <p>I will, however, suppose that the original boundary is everywhere
  rectilinear. It is clear then that, after every cutting, the boundary is
  still rectilinear. If the creases be at right angles to one another, the
  ultimate figure may be an irregular polygon, having its four quarters
  alike, such as may be inscribed in an oval; or it may have its sides so
  many and so small, that the ultimate appearance shall be that of an oval.
  But if the creases be not at right angles, the ultimate figure is a
  perfectly regular polygon, such as can be inscribed in a circle; or its
  sides may be so many and so small that the ultimate appearance shall be
  that of a circle.</p>

  <p>Suppose, as in <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby's</span> question, that
  the creases are not at right angles to each other; supposing the eye and
  the scissors <i>perfect</i>, the results will be as follows:</p>

  <p>First, suppose the angle made by the creases to be what the
  mathematicians call <i>incommensurable</i> with the whole revolution;
  that is, suppose that no repetition of the angle will produce an
  <i>exact</i> number of revolutions. Then the cutting will go on for ever,
  and the result will perpetually approach a circle. It is easily shown
  that no figure whatsoever, except a circle, has two axes of symmetry
  which make an angle incommensurable with the whole revolution.</p>

  <p>Secondly, suppose the angle of the creases commensurable with the
  revolution. Find out the smallest number of times which the angle must be
  repeated to give an exact number of revolutions. If that number be even,
  it is the number of sides of the ultimate polygon: if that number be odd,
  it is the half of the number of sides of the ultimate polygon.</p>

  <p>Thus, the paper on which I write, the whole sheet being taken, and the
  creases made by joining opposite corners, happens to give the angle of
  the creases very close to three-fourteenths of a revolution; so that
  fourteen repetitions of the angle is the lowest number which give an
  exact number of revolutions; and a very few cuttings lead to a regular
  polygon of fourteen sides. But if four-seventeenths of a revolution had
  been taken for the angle of the creases, the ultimate polygon would have
  had thirty-four sides. In an angle taken at hazard the chances are that
  the number of ultimate sides will be large enough to present a circular
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Any reader who chooses may amuse himself by trying results from three
  or more axes, whether all passing through one point or not.</p>

  <p>Some of your correspondents, <span class="sc">Sir James E.

  all have thrown new light on what I consider a very curious inquiry. The
  following document I discovered some years ago in the Lord Steward's
  Offices. Your readers will see its value at once; but it may not be amiss
  to observe, that the name in its present application had its origin in
  the number of masterless boys hanging about the verge of the Court and
  other public places, palaces, coal-cellars, and palace stables; ready
  with links to light coaches and chairs, and conduct, and rob people on
  foot, through the dark streets of London; nay, to follow the Court in its
  progresses to Windsor and Newmarket. Pope's "link-boys vile" are the
  black-guard boys of the following Proclamation.</p>

  rogues, commonly called the Black-guard, with divers other lewd and loose
  fellowes, vagabonds, vagrants, and wandering men and women, do usually

<h3>THE CALVES' HEAD CLUB.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 315. 480.)</p>

  <p>The Calves' Head Club existed much earlier than the time when their
  doings were commemorated in the <i>Weekly Oracle</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  315.) of February 1, 1735, or depicted in the print of 1734 (Vol. viii.,
  p. 480.). There is a pamphlet, <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>the second edition of which was published in
  small 4to., in 1703, entitled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Secret History of the Calves' Head Club, or, the Republican
  Unmasqu'd, wherein is fully shewn the Religion of the Calves-Head Heroes
  in their Anniversary Thanksgiving Songs on the Thirtieth of January, by
  their Anthems," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We are told in the latter part of the long title-page that the work
  was published "to demonstrate the restless, inplacable spirit of a
  certain party still among us," and certainly the statements therein, and
  more than all the anthems at the end, do show the bitterest
  hatred&mdash;so bitter, so intense and malignant, that we feel on reading
  it that there must be some exaggeration.</p>

  <p>The author professes to have at first been of opinion "that the story
  was purely contrived on purpose to render the republicans more odious
  than they deserv'd." Whether he was convinced to the contrary by ocular
  demonstration he does not tell us, but gives us information he received
  from a gentleman&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Who, about eight years ago, went out of meer curiosity to see their
  Club, and has since furnish'd me with the following papers. I was
  inform'd that it was kept in no fix'd house, but that they remov'd as
  they saw convenient; that the place they met in when he was with 'em was
  in a blind ally, about Morefields; that the company wholly consisted of
  Independents and Anabaptists (I am glad for the honour of the
  Presbyterians to set down this remark); that the famous Jerry White,
  formerly Chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, who no doubt on't came to sanctify
  with his pious exhortations the Ribbaldry of the Day, said Grace; that
  after the table-cloth was removed, the anniversary anthem, as they
  impiously called it, was sung, and a calve's skull fill'd with wine, or
  other liquor, and then a brimmer went about to the pious memory of those
  worthy patriots that kill'd the tyrant, and deliver'd their country from
  arbitrary sway; and lastly, a collection made for the mercenary scribler,
  to which every man contributed according to his zeal for the cause, or
  the ability of his purse.</p>

  <p>"I have taken care to set down what the gentleman told me as
  faithfully as my memory wou'd give me leave; and I am persuaded that some
  persons that frequent the Black Boy in Newgate Street, as they knew the
  author of the following lines so they knew this account of the Calves'
  Head Club to be true."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The anthems for the years 1693, 1694, 1695, 1696, and 1697, are given;
  but they are too long and too stupidly blasphemous and indecent to quote
  here. They seem rather the satires of malignant cavaliers than the
  serious productions of any Puritan, however politically or theologically
  heretical.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>The Calotype Process.</i>&mdash;I have made any first essay in the
  calotype process, following <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span>
  directions given in "N. &amp; Q.," and using Turner's paper, as
  recommended by him. My success has been quite as great as I could expect
  as a novice, and satisfies me that any defects are due to my own want of
  skill, and not to any fault in the directions given. I wish, however, to
  ask a question as to iodizing the paper. <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span> says, lay the paper on the solution; then
  <i>immediately</i> remove it, and lay on the dry side on blotting-paper,
  &amp;c. Now I find, if I remove immediately, the whole sheet of paper
  curls up into a roll, and is quite unmanageable. I want to know,
  therefore, whether there is any objection to allowing the paper to remain
  on the iodizing solution until it lies flat on it, so that on removal it
  will not curl, and may be easily and conveniently laid on the dry side to
  pass the glass rod over it. As soon as the paper is floated on the
  solution (I speak of Turner's) it has a great tendency to curl, and takes
  some time before the expansion of both surfaces becoming equal allows it
  to lie quite flat on the liquid. May this operation be performed by the
  glass rod, without floating at all?</p>

  <p>Photographers, like myself, at a distance from practical instruction,
  are so much obliged for plain and simple directions such as those given
  by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, which are the result of
  experience, that I am sure he will not mind being troubled with a few
  inquiries relative to them.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Society's Exhibition.</i>&mdash;The Photographic

  Daguerreotypes at the Gallery of the Society of British Artists, in
  Suffolk Street, with a <i>soirée</i> on Tuesday evening last.
  Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, the rooms were crowded not
  only by members of the Society, but by many of the most distinguished
  literary and scientific men of the metropolis. The Queen and Prince
  Albert had, in the course of the morning, spent three hours in an
  examination of the collection; and the opinion they expressed, that the
  exhibition was one of great interest and promise, from the evidence it
  afforded of the extraordinary advance made by the art during the past
  year, and the encouragement it held out to the belief that far greater
  excellence might therefore still be looked for in it, was a very just
  one, and embodied that given afterwards by the most competent
  authorities. We have not room this week to enter into any details, but
  can confidently recommend our readers to pay an early visit to Suffolk
  Street.</p>

  <p><i>"Firm was their faith," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  564.).&mdash;These lines are to be found in a poem called "Morwennæ
  Statio, hodie Morwenstow," published by Masters in 1846, with the title
  of <i>Echoes from Old Cornwall</i>, and written by the Vicar of
  Morwenstow. I agree with D.&nbsp;M. in the judgment he has announced as to
  their merits; but hitherto they have been but little appreciated by the
  public. A time will come however, when these and other compositions of
  the author will be better known and more duly valued by the English
  mind.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Saxa.</span></p>

  <p>These lines were written on "the Minster of Morwenna," May, 1840, and
  appeared in the <i>British Magazine</i> under the anonymous name
  <i>Procul</i>. Of the eight stanzas of which the poem consists, P.&nbsp;M. has
  quoted the second. The second line should be read "wise <i>of</i> heart,"
  and the third "<i>firm</i> and trusting hands." With your correspondent,
  I hope the author's name may be discovered.</p>

  <p><i>Solar Eclipse in the Year 1263</i> (Vol. viii., p. 441.).&mdash;In
  the <i>Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 350., there are "Observations on the Norwegian Expedition against
  Scotland in the year 1263," by John Dillon, Esq.; and at pp. 363-4, when
  speaking of the annular eclipse, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The eclipse above mentioned is described to have occurred between
  these two dates [29th July and 9th August]. This being pointed out to Dr.
  Brewster, he had the curiosity to calculate the eclipse, when he found
  that there was an eclipse of the sun on 5th August, 1263, and which was
  annular at Ronaldsvo, in Orkney, and the middle of it was twenty-four
  minutes past one."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These "Observations" contain much curious information; but are
  deformed by the author attempting to wrest the text of the Norwegian
  writer (at p. 358. and in note I.) to suit an absurd crotchet of his own.
  Having seen that essay in MS., I pointed out those errors; but instead of
  attending to my observations, he would not read them, and got into a

  <p><i>Lines on Woman</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 292. 350. &amp;c.).&mdash;The
  lines on Woman are, I presume, an altered version of those of Barret

  the correct version is the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p><i>Satin</i> (Vol. vii., p. 551.).&mdash;In a note just received by me
  from Canton, an American friend of mine remarks as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When you write again to 'N. &amp; Q.' you can say that the word
  <i>satin</i> (Vol. vii., p. 551.), like the article itself, is of Chinese
  origin, and that other foreign languages, in endeavouring like the
  English to imitate the Chinese <i>sz-tün</i>, have <!-- Page 18 --><span

  it, and to each other. Of this the answers to the Query given in the

  <p>I suspect that he is right, and that Ogilvie and Webster, whom you

  <p><i>The Third Part of "Christabel"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 11.
  111.).&mdash;Has the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i> any other reason for
  ascribing this poem to Maginn than the common belief which makes him the
  sole and original Morgan Odoherty? If not, its evidence is of little
  value, as, exclusive of some pieces under that name which have been
  avowed by other writers, many of the Odoherty papers contain palpable
  internal evidence of having been written by a Scotchman, or at least one
  very familiar with Scotland, which at that time he was not; even the
  letter accompanying the third part of <i>Christabel</i> is dated from
  Glasgow, and though this would in itself prove nothing, the circumstances
  above mentioned, as well as Dr. Moir's evidence as to the time when
  Maginn's contributions to <i>Blackwood</i> commenced, seems strongly
  presumptive against his claim. Some of the earliest and most
  distinguished writers in <i>Blackwood</i> are still alive, and could, no
  doubt, clear up this point at once, if so inclined.</p>

  <p><i>Attainment of Majority</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 198. 250.).&mdash;In my
  last communication upon this subject I produced undeniable authority to
  prove that the law did not regard the fraction of a day; this, I think,
  A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. will admit. The question is, now, does the day on which a man
  attains his majority commence at six o'clock <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span>, or at midnight? We must remember that we are
  dealing with a question of <i>English</i> law; and therefore the evidence
  of an English decision will, I submit, be stronger proof of the latter
  mode of reckoning than the only positive proof with which A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. has
  defended Ben Jonson's use of the former, viz. <i>Roman</i>.</p>

  <p>In a case tried in Michaelmas Term, 1704, Chief Justice Holt said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It has been adjudged that if one be born the 1st of February at
  eleven at night, and the last of January in the twenty-first year of his
  age at one o'clock in the morning, he makes his will of lands and dies,
  it is a good will, for he was then of age."&mdash;<i>Salkeld</i>, 44.;
  <i>Raymond</i>, 480, 1096; 1 <i>Siderfin</i>, 162.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this case, therefore, the testator was accounted of age forty-six
  hours before the completion of his twenty-first year. Now, the law not
  regarding the fraction of a day, the above case, I submit, clearly proves
  that the day, as regards the attainment of majority, began at
  midnight.</p>

  my possession a codicil of Mrs. Conduit's will in her own hand, dated
  26th of January, 1737. This document refers to some theological tracts by
  Sir Isaac Newton, in his handwriting, which I have. On referring to the
  pedigree of the Barton family, I find that Colonel Robert Barton married
  Catherine Greenwood, whose father lived at Rotterdam, and was ancestor of
  Messrs. Greenwood, army agents. His issue were Major Newton Barton, who
  married Elizabeth Ekins, Mrs. Burr, and Catherine Robert Barton. I find
  no mention of Colonel Noel Barton. The family of Ekins had been
  previously connected with that of Barton, Alexander Ekins, Rector of
  Barton Segrave, having married Jane Barton of Brigstock. The writer of
  this note will be obliged if J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;J., or any correspondent of "N. &amp;

  ever of the Privy Council; but, in 1539, one of the Gentlemen of the
  Privy Chamber to King Henry VIII. (which monarch granted to him in 1546-7
  the manor of Willoughby in Edmonton, co. Middlesex), Sir Thomas Hoby, the
  brother, and successor in the estates of Sir Philip, was, in 1566,

  1596), aged thirty-six. The coat of the Hobys of Bisham, as correctly
  given, is "Argent, within a border engrailed sable, three spindles,
  threaded in fesse, gules." A grant or confirmation of this coat was made
  by Sir Edward Bysshe, Clarenceux, to Peregrine Hoby of Bisham, Berks,

  from 1790 to 1803 inclusive; and that King George III. repeatedly
  reviewed it, accompanied by the queen and the royal family. That the

  and succeeded Sir W. A. Pitt as colonel of it in July 18, 1796. That the
  regiment was reviewed on Hounslow Heath by the King in August, 1799; and
  the Prince of Wales (who commanded it in person) received his Majesty's
  orders to convey his Majesty's approbation of its excellent appearance
  and performance. Perhaps the picture by Sir William Beechey was painted
  in 1799, and not 1798. I did not find the catalogue at Hampton Court free

  misspelt and mistranslated. Allow me to furnish you with what I have
  never yet seen in English, a correct version of it:</p>

  <p><i>Queen Anne's Motto</i> (Vol. viii., p. 174.).&mdash;The Historical
  Society of Pennsylvania is in possession of an English coat of arms,
  painted on wood in the time of Queen Anne, having "Anna R." at the top,
  and the motto <i>Semper eadem</i> on the scroll below. It probably was in
  one of the Philadelphia court-rooms, and was taken down at the
  Revolution.</p>

  <p><i>Lawyers' Bags</i> (Vol. vii. <i>passim</i>).&mdash;The
  communication of <span class="sc">Mr. Kersley</span>, in p. 557.,
  although it does not support the inference which <span class="sc">Col.
  Landman</span> draws, that the colour of lawyers' bags was changed in
  consequence of the unpopularity which it acquired at the trial of Queen
  Caroline, seems to show that <i>green</i> was at one time the colour of
  those professional pouches. The question still remains, when and on what
  occasion it was discontinued; and when the purple, and when the crimson,
  were introduced?</p>

  <p>When I entered the profession (about fifty years ago), no junior
  barrister presumed to carry a bag in the Court of Chancery, unless one
  had been presented to him by a king's counsel; who, when a junior was
  advancing in practice, took an opportunity of complimenting him on his
  increase of business, and giving him his own bag to carry home his
  papers. It was then a distinction to carry a bag, and a proof that a
  junior was rising <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>in his profession. I do not know whether the
  same custom prevailed in the other courts.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Causidicus.</span></p>

  <p>In this city (Philadelphia) lawyers formerly carried green bags. The
  custom has declined of late years among the members of the legal
  profession, and it has been taken up by journeymen boot and shoe makers,
  who thus carry their work to and from the workshop. A green bag is now
  the badge of a cordwainer in this city.</p>

  <p><i>Bust of Luther</i> (Vol. viii., p. 335.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. J.&nbsp;G. Fitch</span> asks for information respecting a bust
  of Luther, with an inscription, on the wall of a house, in the Dom Platz
  at Frankfort on the Maine. I have learned, through a German acquaintance,
  who has resided the greater part of his life in that city, that the
  effigy was erected to commemorate the event of Luther's having, during a
  short stay in Frankfort, preached near that spot; and that the words
  surrounding the bust were his text on the occasion. He adds that Luther
  at no period of his life "lived for some years" at Frankfort, as stated
  by <span class="sc">Mr. Fitch</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Grammar in relation to Logic</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 514.
  629.).&mdash;H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K.'s remarks are of course indisputable. But it is a
  mistake to suppose that they answer my Query. In fact, had your
  correspondent taken the trouble to consider the meaning of my Query, he
  could not have failed to perceive that the explanation I there gave of
  the function of the conjunction <i>in logic</i>, is the same as his. My
  Query had sole reference <i>to grammar</i>. I would also respectfully
  suggest that anonymous correspondents should not impute "superficial
  views," or any other disagreeable thing, to those who stand
  <i>confessed</i>, without abandoning the pseudonym.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Timbs announces for publication by subscription, <i>Curiosities of
  London: exhibiting the most rare and remarkable Objects of Interest in
  the Metropolis</i>. Mr. Timbs states, the authorities for his work have
  been four-and-twenty years in collection; and that the utmost pains has
  been taken to verify names, dates, and circumstances, so as to insure
  accuracy. In this labour the author has been aided by the communications
  of many obliging friends, as well as by his own recollection of nearly
  fifty years' changes in the aspects of "opulent, enlarged, and still
  increasing London."</p>

  <p>It is proposed to publish by subscription <i>The Visitation of the
  County of Northumberland</i>, taken by Richard St. George, Esq., Norroy
  King of Arms, and Henry St. George, Esq., Blue Mantle Pursuivant of Arms,
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1615. To be printed in tables on folio,
  with the arms engraved on wood, price One Guinea; or large paper, royal
  folio, Two Guineas; or large paper with the arms emblazoned (of which
  only the number subscribed for will be done), Five Guineas. Subscribers'
  names will be received by Mr. John Gray Bell, No. 17. Bedford Street,
  Covent Garden.</p>

  <p>The first number of the <i>Antiquities of Shropshire</i>, by the Rev.
  R.&nbsp;W. Eyton, has just been issued for the sake of determining the
  author's doubts as to whether there is any general wish for such a
  publication. Should the answer be in the negative, the author will
  neither forget his obligation to present subscribers, nor the explanation
  which he will farther owe them if the work be discontinued. The work will
  extend at least to five volumes, or twenty parts, and, according to the
  present plan, will be completed in not less than five years. Any
  subscriber will be at liberty to withdraw his name, by giving notice to
  that effect within one month after the publication of any fourth part, or
  completed volume. Three hundred copies of Part I. have been printed, but
  the number of the future parts will be limited to those subscribed for
  within the next three months.</p>

  <p><i>The Surrey Archæological Society</i> propose holding the Inaugural
  General Meeting of the Society in Southwark early in the month of
  February, and to exhibit upon the occasion a collection of such objects
  of antiquarian interest relating to Surrey as may be contributed for that
  purpose. Parties are invited to favour the Society with the loan of such
  objects.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>A Peep at the Pixies,
  or Legends of the West</i>, by Mrs. Bray: written for the entertainment
  of a family circle, these amusing records of the doings of the little
  people will find favour with all lovers of folk lore.&mdash;<i>Ada's
  Thoughts, or the Poetry of Youth</i>, may be commended for its natural,
  simple, yet elevated tone.&mdash;<i>Essay on Human Happiness</i>, by
  C.&nbsp;B. Adderley, M.P.; the first of a series of <i>Great Truths for
  Thoughtful Hours</i>. A set of little books similar in object and design
  to Pickering's well-known series of <i>Small Books on Great
  Subjects</i>.&mdash;<i>Beauties of Byron, Verse and Prose.</i> This
  selection, made for Murray's <i>Railway Reading</i>, will be acceptable
  to many who would object to place the collected edition of the noble
  bard's writings in the hands of the younger members of their
  family.&mdash;<i>Speeches on Parliamentary Reform</i>, by the Right Hon.
  T.&nbsp;B. Macaulay. This new number of Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i>
  is well-timed, and very acceptable.</p>
